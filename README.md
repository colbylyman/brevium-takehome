# Brevium Takehome Project

The project is written in Java. I was able to finish everything except for the logic on finding where an appointment would fit into a doctors schedule. All API requests are divided up into functions in the RequestHandler which then uses the HttpConnectionClient class for web communication. The ResponseCodeChecker class is used for debugging as well as displaying what the API response was to the user.
